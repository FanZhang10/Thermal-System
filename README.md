#Thermal System

Introduction  


Automated planning and scheduling, in the relevant literature often denoted as simply planning, is a branch of artificial intelligence that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences, typically for execution by intelligent agents, autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles. Unlike classical control and classification problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to decision theory. 
For my object, I would like to introduce a thermal system, which is really used in China. In Canada, most people are living in house, and each house has their own central air conditioning. In northern China are as cold as in Canada. But unlike in Canada, most Chinese people are living in apartments without air condition.  They even do not have own central air conditioning for each apartment. In order to meet Chinaâ€™s national conditions, the Chinese government set up some special facilities to ensure that people warm in winter. These facilities use coal to heat water, hot water will be transported through special pipelines to every household, using the dissipate heat of hot water from the pipeline to keep the room warm.  Therefore, the problem is between user needs and plan production time.
